# python-SPFD54124B
A python driver module for the Nokia 1616 color LCD on Olimex A20-SOM204. 

#Requirements

Requires a hardware SPI and/or GPIO ports as python objects to control the display.

# Work in progress
This is minimal code that just initializes the LCD and paints some backgrounds.
It has only been tested with a bit-banging SPI through the python GPIO module.
